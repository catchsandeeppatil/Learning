				<q>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
					Five score years ago a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the Emancipation Proclamation. 
This momentous decree is a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. 
It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity</q>.
